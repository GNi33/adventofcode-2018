# Advent of Code - 2018

My implementation of the [2018 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018), which I basically used to get 
into Kotlin a little bit. That is also why it is not directly split into single days, but I tried to structure it 
like an actual application a little, to give me the opportunity to also explore other aspects of Kotlin application 
development aside from only solving the daily puzzles.

Obviously very WIP.
